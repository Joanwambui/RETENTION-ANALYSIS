Cohort analysis is a data analysis technique that is used to understand the behavior of a group of individuals (cohort) over time. It categorizes customers into groups based on common characteristics, such as when they first became customers (cohort period), and tracks their behaviors and purchasing patterns over time.
To create our cohort index we first identified the cohort period, which is typically the month in which a customer first made a purchase. Then we made a table that categorizes each customer into a cohort based on their first purchase date such that it would show customer's return to make their second or > second purchase, and calculated the retention rate for each cohort.
